Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling software for molecular description calculations and activity prediction through machine learning methods.

Project Files:
- Interface.py: Main interface file that runs the Tkinter window application
- InputFrame.py: Tkinter frame that allows for data to be uploaded, deleted, computed, exported, analyzed and visualized
- TableFrame.py: Tkinter frame that shows a dataframe of calculated descriptor values and activity predictions
- OutputFrame.py: Tkinter frame that allows for user to navigate through the uploaded data, visualize 2D molecular images, and see individual values
